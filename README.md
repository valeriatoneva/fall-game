## Game 2: Fall Game

### Description

This is a simple falling game implemented using JavaScript. The game features a character that falls down, and the objective is to navigate the character through gaps in blocks that appear at the top of the screen. The game utilizes the HTML DOM API for manipulating the character and block elements and their styles.

### Technologies Used
